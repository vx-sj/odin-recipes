    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While tacos these days take many shapes and forms, we know that even these basic chicken tacos are not the most
        authentic. The taco history is long and rich and is originally a form of Mexican street food. These are a much
        more Americanized form of taco, meaning that it's a tortilla filled with spiced meats and yummy toppings. While
        the true definition and origin of a taco can be quite blurry, we know one thing for sure - tacos are our
        favorite food group. Try these quick and easy tacos for your next Taco Tuesday and don't forget the margarita!
