    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sheet pan dinners have become a big thing in my house. I pretty much make a sheet pan dinner almost every other
        day. You basically toss all the ingredients in a large sheet pan, top with your favorite herbs and spices and
        bake!</p>
    <p>This Chicken and Veggies sheet pan dinner is a healthy choice with lean protein and plenty of veggies, yet it is
        a perfectly hearty and flavorful meal thanks to the garlic and herbs. The chicken and veggies are coated with
        garlic, olive oil, fresh lime (or lemon) juice, and gourmet garden lightly dried herbs. I love the trio
        combination of garlic, herbs and lime and it goes so well with chicken and veggies.</p>
