# odin-recipes
Basic recipe website project for The Odin Project

First full project from The Odin project's curriculum. Basic use of HTML put into practice by building a basic recipe website with a main index page with links to a few recipes. This project will demonstrate knowledge and ability to write HTML to create a basic webpage, as well as the ability to use and further practice with VS code text editor. Also demonstrates and improves upon ability to utilize git hub, git, git commands, and terminal commands in general workflow to create and work on project repository.

Will revisit this project later in curriculum to style it with CSS.
